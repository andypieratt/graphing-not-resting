# graphing-not-resting

## Description:

This application is refactored code that uses GraphQL and Apollo Server on the back-end. I added the neccessary GraphQL components on the server side which included some TypeDefs and Resolvers that the front-end/client-side would use as mutations and queries to create, read, update, and delete data based on the actions of the user.
